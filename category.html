                    <h3>Jordans - Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals</h3>
                    <p>
                        What can possibly be more valuable than a pair of solid gold Jordans? The pair Michael Jordan wore during Game 2 of the 1998 NBA Finals. The same final that the Chicago Bulls won,
                         marking Jordan’s sixth NBA championship victory and his final season with the Bulls.

                        The game was featured in The Last Dance, an ESPN/Netflix documentary about Jordan’s final season with the Chicago Bulls.
                        Auction house Sotheby’s leveraged the documentary’s success to put this pair on auction in April 2023. While setting a record for the most expensive sneakers ever sold, it still comes shy of the $4 Million Sotheby’s hoped to fetch from the auction.

                        Interesting fact about this pair: Sotheby’s says that Jordan autographed the shoes and gave them to a ball-boy after the game. 
                        The auction house didn’t specify, however, if that boy was the seller in 2023. We don’t know who the buyer is either.

                    <h3>Hallucination</h3>
                    <p>
                        The most expensive watch ever made is another Graff Diamonds creation. The Hallucination is, as the name suggests, truly breathtaking and brilliantly fantastical. 

                        Featuring a kaleidoscopic array of 110 carats of different colored diamonds in a range of different cuts, set into a platinum bracelet, 
                        The Hallucination brings high fashion to the world of Horlogerie. About as far from a tactical watch as you can get,
                        it’s almost easy to forget this piece’s timekeeping capabilities, but there is a tiny dial in the center of all that sparkle.

                    <p>
                        Indeed when it comes to hugely expensive eyewear this tends to mainly be in the field of sunglasses, 
                        which is perhaps no surprise as it’s in this field that truly stylish looks can be best completed.
                        Now the actual glasses are pretty plain in terms of the manufacturing of the pair. Made of plastic, but custom made.

                    <h3>Asymmetrical Necklace </h3>
                    <p>A necklace featuring a giant 163.41-carat colorless diamond
                        Eighteen emerald-cut diamonds adorn one side of the necklace, while emeralds decorate the other.
                         Its centerpiece is the colorless diamond: a D color, IIA type diamond — the rarest and most valuable kind.

                        “It goes perfectly — the main stone with the necklace, it looks like just a beautiful piece,” 
                        said Fawaz Gruosi, the founder of de Grisogono, the Swiss luxury jeweler that created the unique necklace.
